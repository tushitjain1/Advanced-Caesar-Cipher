# Advanced-Caesar-Cipher
Caesar Cipher c#  
Task:
In this version a message M is encoded using a key K.
This key is an n letter word that is transposed into the 
alphabet Key (A=1 , B=2, C=3) to produce the shift pattern.
The message is then shifted using the Cesar cipher on this repeating key. 
You should code two solutions one where:
1) The shift resets each time
2) The shift carry on from where the last shift ended.
